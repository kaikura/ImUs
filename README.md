# ImUs
*ImUs* is an application that develops through the interaction with others. It investigates the sense of collectivity that technology can enhance and evolve. We believe collectivity to be something more than the sum of individuals.
*ImUs* is rooted in the key ideas of New Media Art:

- **Materiality:** the audience is engaged through the physical world
- **Embodiment:** mind and body have the same weight, they're not treated separately
- **The Cyborg:** the application have a certain degree of autonomy
- **Hybridity:** hybridity of disciplines involved is self evident; real world and virtual world merge through sound modulation and through visualization
- **Narrative:** the experience have starting point and a climax that can be reached by the audience
- **Interactivity:** the piece works through people

We developed the experience being inspired by those concepts, trying to convey our message.

# Tools
- *Exploration Space* - The portion of space dedicated to the users
- *First Camera* - Takes user photos
- *Second Camera* - Track users in the exploration space
- *Loudspeakers* - To listen to the exploration results
- *Projecting Screen* - To see the exploration results

# Face Capture 
The users take pictures of their faces. The visualized ellipse defines the correct position and centering. Once the photos have been taken the *exploration space* is ready to be used.

# People Tracking
As people enter in the *exploration space* they are tracked by the camera. They are free to move and interact with others. They'll find themself immersed in a soundscape.

# Environmental Sound Modulation
What the user will hear is that their physical presence have an effect on the sound landscape they're immersed in.

# Face Merging and Visualization
What the user will see is that their physical presence have an effect on the visualization.
The faces obtained initially are merged, and their merging is visualized as a transaction video. The clarity
